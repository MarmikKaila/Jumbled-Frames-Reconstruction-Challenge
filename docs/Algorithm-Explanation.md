#  Algorithm Explanation — Jumbled Frames Reconstruction Challenge

## 1️. Introduction

This project reconstructs the correct temporal order of a **10-second, 1080p, 30 FPS** jumbled video consisting of 300 shuffled frames.  
The challenge is to determine the correct sequence of frames without any metadata, timestamps, or prior motion information.

The reconstruction is achieved using **deep visual similarity**, **perceptual metrics**, and **optimization algorithms** that collectively reorder the frames into their original chronological order.



## 2️. Problem Definition

Given:
> A set of frames {F₁, F₂, ..., Fₙ} randomly shuffled from a single-shot video.

Goal:
> Find the permutation **P** that minimizes the total dissimilarity between consecutive frames.

Formally:
```
Minimize  ∑ (1 - Similarity(F_P[i], F_P[i+1]))  for all i = 1 to n-1
```



## 3️. Step-by-Step Approach

### **Step 1: Frame Extraction**
- Extracts all frames using **OpenCV**.  
- Each frame is resized and normalized for consistency.

### **Step 2: Deep Feature Extraction**
- A **ResNet50** model (pre-trained on ImageNet) is used to compute a **2048-dimensional embedding** for each frame.  
- These embeddings represent high-level visual understanding — objects, motion, and lighting patterns.

### **Step 3: Structural Similarity (SSIM)**
- Converts frames to grayscale and computes **SSIM** between every pair.  
- SSIM captures local pixel relationships, edges, and texture.

### **Step 4: Hybrid Similarity Matrix**
- Combines deep and structural similarities:
  ```
  HybridSim = 0.7 * CosineSimilarity(ResNetFeatures) + 0.3 * SSIM
  ```
- This provides a balanced view of both high-level semantics and low-level structure.

### **Step 5: Frame Sequencing (Greedy Approach)**
- Starts from an arbitrary frame.  
- Iteratively selects the next most similar unvisited frame according to the HybridSim metric.  
- Produces an initial sequence that roughly approximates the correct order.

### **Step 6: Local Optimization (2-Opt)**
- The initial greedy sequence is refined using **2-Opt optimization** (similar to the TSP heuristic).  
- If swapping two frame positions reduces total dissimilarity, the swap is performed.  
- This continues until no further improvement is possible.

### **Step 7: Reverse Detection and Correction**
- Checks global cosine similarity trend to identify if the reconstructed sequence is reversed.  
- If reversed, the sequence order is flipped automatically.

### **Step 8: Video Reconstruction**
- The final ordered frames are written to a video file (`reconstructed_video.mp4`) using **OpenCV VideoWriter**.  
- Frame rate and dimensions are maintained identical to the input.



| **Step** | **Code Section** | **Description / Purpose** |
|-----------|------------------|----------------------------|
| **1️. Frame Extraction** | `cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_input_path)`<br>Loop under `for _ in tqdm(range(total_frames)):` | Reads all frames from **jumbled_video.mp4** using OpenCV and stores them in a list `frames`. Maintains original dimensions and FPS. |
| **2️. Deep Feature Extraction (ResNet50)** | `extract_features(frames)` | Loads **ResNet50 (ImageNet pre-trained)** to extract a **2048-dimensional embedding** representing semantic content of each frame (objects, scenes, etc.). |
| **3️. Structural Similarity (SSIM)** | Inside `calculate_ai_difference(pair)` | Converts frames to grayscale and computes **SSIM** between pairs. Captures texture, lighting, and local structure similarity. |
| **4️. Hybrid Similarity Matrix** | Inside `calculate_ai_difference(pair)` and matrix build loop | Combines **cosine similarity (ResNet)** and **SSIM** into a single hybrid metric:<br>`0.3 × cosine_dist + 0.7 × ssim_diff`. Balances high-level and low-level similarity. |
| **5️. Frame Sequencing (Greedy Ordering)** | `order_frames_hybrid(diff_matrix)` | Builds an initial frame sequence by selecting the next frame with **minimum difference** from the last ordered frame (greedy traversal). |
| **6️. Local Optimization (2-Opt)** | Inside `order_frames_hybrid()` (second loop) | Performs **local swaps** of neighboring frames if the total dissimilarity decreases — improves sequence accuracy (**TSP-inspired 2-opt heuristic**). |
| **7️. Reverse Detection & Correction** | `auto_correct_direction()` | Checks similarity between first–middle–last frames. If a backward trend is detected, automatically **reverses** the sequence. |
| **8️. Video Reconstruction (Output)** | `out = cv2.VideoWriter(...)`<br>`for idx in tqdm(ordered_indices):` | Writes the ordered frames into a new video file **reconstructed_video.mp4** using OpenCV’s **VideoWriter**. |
| ** Performance Optimization (Parallelism)** | `ThreadPoolExecutor` in feature extraction & difference computation | Uses **multithreading** to compute features and differences faster — significantly reduces total runtime. |
| ** Execution Logging** | `tqdm` progress bars & printed logs | Provides runtime feedback (frame reading, feature extraction, comparisons, writing). Helps track each pipeline stage. |




## 4️. Performance Optimization

- **Multithreading:** Uses `ThreadPoolExecutor` to parallelize similarity computation.  
- **Caching:** Stores intermediate features to avoid recomputation.  
- **Batch Processing:** Handles large frame sets efficiently without memory overload.
